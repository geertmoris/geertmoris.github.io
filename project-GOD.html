         <p>During one of my previous jobs, at a rental company of sound and light installations, I was responsible for the rigging
           (maintenance, repairs, technical inspection, etc.). One of the tasks was the regular greasing of the chains of the electric
           hoists (2000 pieces, every 4 months); a time-consuming and boring job. Therefore I decided to automate this.</p><br>
        <p>The machine did have to meet a number of requirements:</p>

        <ul class='project-list'>
          <li>5 types of hoists</li>
          <li>5 types of flightcases</li>
          <li>3 types of chains, different lengths</li>
          <li>3 different chain speeds</li>
          <li>greasing without removing chain from hoist</li>
          <li>safe to use</li>
          <li>if anything goes wrong, the machine has to stop</li>
          <li>feedback regarding proces error</li>
          <li>Machine must be able to be made compact for transport by small van to our other locations abroad.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>Then the design started: Searching for existing techniques and parts, study of pneumatics (with which I was not familiar),
          all kinds of calculations, designing parts that had to be made to measure, etc. And finally drawing everything in 3D.</p>

            <img src= 'images/complete.png' width=30%/>
        </div>

         <p>The next steps were to purchase and/or have parts made.
           Meanwhile, I made schematics of the electricity, pneumatics and program for the PLC control.</p><br>
         <p>Finally, everything had to be assembled, adjusted and tested. Then the machine was officially put into operation.
          It turned out to be a successful undertaking that took a lot of work out of my hands.  I was able to enjoy it myself
          for a few more years before I left the company.</p><br>

               <img src= 'images/logo-control.png' width=30%/>

            <span style='font-size:0.8em;'>Sorry, only with Dutch subtitles.</span><span style='font-size:1.8em;'>&#128542;</span></p><br>

          <p>Now, more then 10 years later, the machine still works and the company has even had a second one made.</p>
          <p>This was a very challenging project that I thoroughly enjoyed.
